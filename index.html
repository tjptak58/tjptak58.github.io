        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>My name's TJ Ptak and I'm a Junior at Purdue University studying computer science. My biggest interests are web development and systems programming. Outside of classes and internships, I like programming audio applications using Javascript and C++. It's a great way to practice technical concepts while doing something I'm passionate about.</p>
